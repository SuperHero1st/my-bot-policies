    <h1>User Data Deletion Instructions</h1>
    <p>This page explains how data related to your interaction with our Telegram bot (which fetches public Facebook posts) is handled and how you can request its deletion.</p>

    <h2>Data Handled by the Bot</h2>
    <p>The bot primarily handles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Publicly available posts from a specified Facebook Page.</li>
        <li>Your Telegram user ID, if you interact with the bot, to send you messages.</li>
        <li>The ID of the last Facebook post sent, to avoid duplicates.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The bot does not store extensive personal data about you from Telegram or Facebook.</p>

    <h2>How to Request Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>Since the bot does not maintain extensive user-specific databases, the primary way to "delete" your data is to stop interacting with the bot:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Stop/Block the Bot on Telegram:</strong> You can stop or block the bot in your Telegram application. This will prevent the bot from sending you any further messages or processing any commands from you. The bot will no longer have active access to your Telegram user ID for direct communication.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The bot is designed to be stateless regarding individual user data beyond immediate operational needs. If you have specific concerns or believe data is being retained inappropriately, please contact the bot administrator (if contact information is provided within the bot or its associated project page).</p>
